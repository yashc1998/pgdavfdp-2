                        <hr>
                        <p class="black-text">PGDAV College is a constituent college of University of Delhi, having
                            been established in
                            1957. Recently it celebrated its Diamond Jubilee wherein the President of India, Dr. Ram
                            Nath Kovind, graced the occasion. The institution is guided by the DAV ethos combined with
                            rigorous pedagogy aiming to prepare the disciples to be ethical leaders in the diverse and
                            complex world. The college has been empowering the youth of India through educating and
                            training them, equipping them with creative and critical thinking so that they develop
                            their faculties of discovering, exploring, learning, and growing. For achieving all of
                            this, and then some more, the college has well developed infrastructure – both hard and
                            soft (the intellectual prowess). Thus the college ensures that all the stakeholders enjoy
                            intellectually engaging and fulfilling experience in an all round manner. <br><br>
                            Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC), PGDAV College has been actively pursuing quality
                            development, improvement, and sustenance goals right since its inception so as to deliver
                            excellence in all its endeavors. In this background the cell has been internalized as an
                            integral part of the institution’s systems and processes. The cell has calendar full of
                            forthcoming events that will act as enablers and facilitators of quality management,
                            especially in the sphere of dissemination and creation of knowledge. <br><br>
                            Departments of Commerce and Economics have a combined strength of nearly 70 teachers, about
                            half of whom are doctorate degree holders. The faculty members comprise of youngsters at 25
                            to experienced ones at 65. Many of them share their knowledge at national, international
                            level institutes, participate in public debates, advise various bodies on public policy
                            issues and so on. They are also guiding doctoral level researchers of Delhi and other
                            Universities. In brief they are well qualified and equipped to host this faculty
                            development program.

                        <hr>
                        <p class="black-text">Every serious student of Business and Economics is cognizant of the
                            dynamic
                            interrelationships between businesses and the various environments in which they operate.
                            Accordingly, they must be equipped with a framework and organizational setting within which
                            such relationships operate. This environment, moreover, is widespread and in a constant
                            state of flux, posing additional challenges to the practitioner and preacher of business
                            operations. Identifying and anticipating customers requirements is impossible unless the
                            organization looks outward to understand its external environment and the implications of
                            changes taking place around it. Then only it can be responsive to the evolving
                            opportunities and threats in the marketplace. At the micro level our initial thoughts
                            pertain to existing and potential markets. The changing tastes and preferences of
                            customers, their disposable incomes, and the price and availability of substitutes seem
                            important as do the size, strength, and number of competitors. But equally, if not more,
                            important are the changes in the broader environment which influence these market
                            conditions. <br><br> Demographic changes alter the population of various market segments
                            while tax
                            adjustments affect their purchasing power. Cultural and technical developments may exert
                            even more powerful influence on the longer term supply, demands, profitability, and life
                            cycle of different goods. Rising concern with green environment, gender issues,
                            sustainability, corporate social responsibility, and many more such issues, have caused
                            many businesses to modify their methods of production, product offering, and business
                            practices. In an interconnected world issues like trade wars aint merely curious buzzwords;
                            they hit us on real time basis. Similarly, disruptive innovations like GST change the way
                            business has to be conducted. Macroeconomic numbers and policy pronouncements that are
                            constantly thrown at us by the pink papers, and business news channels baffle us on one
                            hand but, more importantly, challenge us to take stock of them for converting the potential
                            threats into possible profit with no time lost. Nimble and agile are those who constantly
                            monitor, map, and modify business environment to generate profitable businesses. The
                            strategist H.I. Ansoff rightly observed: The firm is a creature of its environment. Its
                            resources, income, problems, opportunities, and the very survival are generated and
                            conditioned by the environment. <br><br>
                            Societal concerns like sustainable development, gender bias, poverty and inequality, are
                            often translated through the legislative process to impact on the freedom of business to
                            manage. The business leader must always be therefore aware that the environment reflects
                            the pressures from a posse of interested groups to which an appropriate response may be
                            called for. Large firms, especially MNCs, may be able to exert greater influence over their
                            business situation but small firms may have the advantage in responding to the need for
                            change more flexibly. <br><br>
                            The term Business Environment, encompassing Economics Environment, refers to the totality
                            of all the relevant forces external to, and beyond the control of, an individual business
                            enterprise. These forces, despite being externally located, continue to exercise a
                            significant and meaningful influence on the life and growth patterns of individual
                            enterprise. The present FDP is focused on the study of contemporary business environment as
                            it obtains in India. The main objective is to transform the participants into better
                            creators and disseminators of the latest knowledge and wisdom in this domain.
